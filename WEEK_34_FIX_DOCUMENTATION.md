# Week 34 Website Update - Complete Fix Documentation
**Date**: August 26, 2025
**Issue**: Website showing Week 27 instead of Week 34 despite updates
**Resolution**: Complete with all integrity fixes applied

## üî¥ Initial Problem Discovered

### Symptom
- Website was stuck displaying Week 27 (July 1-7, 2025) 
- Week 34 updates were not visible despite being added to the code
- Navigation buttons were not working properly

### Root Cause Identified
- **File**: `/Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/visvikbharti.github.io/legacy/js/week-23-override.js`
- This override script was forcing Week 27 to display regardless of other settings
- The script was using multiple aggressive strategies to override any week display

## üìù Complete Fix Process - Step by Step

### Step 1: Identified the Override Script Problem

**File Examined**: `legacy/js/week-23-override.js`

Initial content was forcing Week 27:
```javascript
const TARGET_WEEK = 27;
const TARGET_YEAR = 2025;
const TARGET_RANGE = "July 1 - July 7, 2025";
```

**Command to view**:
```bash
cat /Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/visvikbharti.github.io/legacy/js/week-23-override.js
```

### Step 2: Fixed the Override Script

**File Modified**: `/Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/visvikbharti.github.io/legacy/js/week-23-override.js`

**Edit Applied**:
Changed from Week 27 to Week 34:
```javascript
const TARGET_WEEK = 34;
const TARGET_YEAR = 2025;
const TARGET_RANGE = "August 19 - August 25, 2025";
```

**Edit Command Used**:
```bash
# Used Claude's Edit tool to modify the file
# Changed TARGET_WEEK from 27 to 34
# Changed TARGET_RANGE to "August 19 - August 25, 2025"
```

### Step 3: Git Commit for Override Fix

**Commands**:
```bash
cd /Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/visvikbharti.github.io
git add legacy/js/week-23-override.js
git commit -m "Fix week override script to display Week 34 instead of Week 27

The override script was forcing Week 27 to display. Updated to Week 34 (August 19-25, 2025) for current week display."
git push origin master
```

## üìÑ Manuscript Replacement Process

### Step 1: Initial Wrong File
**Mistakenly used**: `/Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/StickForStats_Migration/stickForStats_research_paper/MANUSCRIPT_REVIEW_AND_REVISION.md`

Converted to DOCX using:
```python
pypandoc.convert_file(input_file, 'docx', outputfile=output_file)
```

### Step 2: Correct File Replacement
**Correct file**: `/Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/StickForStats_Migration/StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025_revised.docx`

**Commands**:
```bash
# Copy correct file to assets
cp /Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/StickForStats_Migration/StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025_revised.docx assets/StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025.docx

# Verify file size (32,826 bytes)
ls -la assets/StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025.docx

# Commit and push
git add assets/StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025.docx
git commit -m "Replace manuscript with correct revised version

- Used the correct file: StickForStats_Manuscript_Aug2025_revised.docx
- File size: 32,826 bytes
- Source: /Users/vishalbharti/Downloads/StickForStats_Migration/
- This is the properly revised manuscript with accurate information"
git push origin master
```

## üîß Technical Details

### JavaScript Override Mechanism
The `week-23-override.js` file uses multiple strategies to force a specific week:
1. Direct DOM manipulation
2. localStorage override
3. Window variable override
4. Periodic checks with setInterval
5. Multiple delayed executions

### Why It Was Hard to Debug
- Override script ran at multiple points in page lifecycle
- Used `!important` CSS rules
- Disabled navigation buttons temporarily
- Ran checks every second for 10 seconds

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Override scripts can be too aggressive** - The multi-strategy approach made debugging difficult
2. **Scientific integrity is paramount** - All claims must be verifiable
3. **Humble representation is better** - Avoid hype and exaggeration in research reports
4. **File verification is crucial** - Always verify the correct source file before replacement

## üöÄ Current Status

- Website correctly displays Week 34 (August 19-25, 2025)
- All content is factually accurate
- Manuscript download provides the correct revised version
- No fabricated data or false claims remain
- Weekly report reflects actual work completed
