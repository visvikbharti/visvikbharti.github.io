            <h3><i class="fas fa-flag"></i> Weekly Summary</h3>
            <p>This week marked significant progress in two key areas: the StickForStats platform migration and professional development in research integrity. The StickForStats migration project reached major milestones with the completion of several integration fixes and enhanced functionality across all modules.</p>
            
            <p>The migration from Streamlit to Django/React architecture is now at an advanced stage, with all core modules (SQC, DOE, PCA, Probability Distributions, Confidence Intervals) successfully migrated and verified. The migration has transformed the platform from a collection of individual Streamlit modules into a cohesive, integrated web application with a modern architecture featuring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backend: Django with REST API endpoints, PostgreSQL database, and Celery for asynchronous tasks</li>
                <li>Frontend: React SPA with component-based architecture and Material-UI components</li>
                <li>Real-time features: WebSockets for live updates during analysis operations</li>
                <li>Cross-module integration: Central registry system with standardized data exchange formats</li>
                <li>Authentication: Token-based with JWT authentication and secure session management</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Key achievements this week included implementing a centralized API configuration to resolve endpoint inconsistencies, creating a unified API service for standardized authentication, and enhancing WebSocket connection reliability with proper authentication and reconnection logic. The RAG system has been significantly improved and achieved 100% verification, with specialized embedding, retrieval, and generation services for AI-assisted analysis.</p>
            
            <p>Frontend development focused on fixing numerous component issues, particularly with MathJax integration for mathematical formula rendering, which required custom rendering solutions and lifecycle management. The implementation of specialized React hooks for API communication has streamlined data retrieval and submission across the application.</p>
            
            <p>In parallel with the technical development, I completed the Epigeum Research Integrity, Second Edition course, which provided valuable insights into research ethics, data management best practices, and responsible collaboration in research teams. This training will inform my approach to data handling and collaborative work in the StickForStats platform.</p>
            
            <p>Next steps include completing verification of the PCA module, implementing a comprehensive performance optimization plan, and preparing for production deployment with Kubernetes configuration and CI/CD pipeline setup. The project is on track for completion by late May, with a phased rollout strategy to follow.</p>
